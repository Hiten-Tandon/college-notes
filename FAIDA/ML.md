Machine Learning is the subset of [[ai|AI]] which deals with continuous improvement in logic based on past and current data. 
There are various subsets of ML algorithms, like:

  - [[FAIDA/Supervised Learning|Supervised Learning]]
  - [[FAIDA/Unsupervised Learning|Unsupervised Learning]]
  - [[FAIDA/Semisupervised Learning|Semisupervised Learning]]
  - [[FAIDA/Reinforcement Learning|Reinforcement Learning]]

To describe the essence of ML though, in ML, you use the information you have about input and output to derive a function. 
Mathematically speaking, 

Let M<sub>I</sub> be the Input Matrix where the element at i<sup>th</sup> row and j<sup>th</sup> column is the j<sup>th</sup> value of i<sup>th</sup> input variable,

Let M<sub>O</sub> be the Output Matrix, where the same conditions apply,

Let $$f(M_{I.r}) = M_{O.r}$$where M<sub>I.r</sub> means r<sup>th</sup> row of the Input Matrix and, 

Let &Phi; be your ML model, 

then, by definition,

$$\phi(M_{I.r}, M_{O.r}) = f$$
