Vertical Asymptotes are [[Parallel Asymptotes]] or [[Asymptotes]] parallel to y-axis. 
To find vertical asymptotes of a curve, we have to put the coefficient the highest power of y in the equation of the curve to 0. The result equation obtained by this is the equation of the vertical asymptote(s).

For example let's say we have an equation: 
$$3x^2y +xy - 4y = 0$$
The highest power of y in equation is 1, hence we set it's coefficient to 0.
$$3x^2 + x -4 = 0$$
This can be easily factorized to 
$$(3x + 4)(x - 1) = 0$$
i.e. $$ x = 1\ or,\ -1\frac{1}{3}$$
Thus this equation has two vertical asymptotes.
