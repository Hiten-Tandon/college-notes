Horizontal Asymptotes are [[Parallel Asymptotes]]
To find horizontal asymptotes of a curve, we have to put the coefficient the highest power of x in the equation of the curve to 0. The result equation obtained by this is the equation of the horizontal asymptote(s).

For ex: Let's say we have the following equation
$$3x^2y +2xy - 4y = 0$$
To obtain it's horizontal asymptote, set, $$3y = 0$$
Thus the horizontal asymptote of the curve is the x-axis.

Let's take another example: $$3x^2y + 2x^2 - 5xy + 3y - 7 = 0$$
Here the highest power of x is 2, hence we put it's coefficient to 0
$$3y + 2 = 0$$
or, $$y = -\frac{2}{3}$$
Let's take yet another example: $$-4x^2 + x^2y^2 + 2xy - y^2 + 3y = 0$$
The highest power of x is 2, hence we put it's coefficient to 0
$$y^2 - 4 = 0$$
$$y^2 = 4$$
or, $$y = \pm 2 $$
i.e. This equation has two horizontal asymptotes, $$y = 2$$ and $$y = -2$$
