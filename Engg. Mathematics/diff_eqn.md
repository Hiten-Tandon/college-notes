A High Order Linear Differential Equation is a differential equation which has the following format.

$$\sum_{i = 0}^n{a_i\frac{d^i}{dx^i}y} = \phi(x)$$
where,

- $n \in \mathbb{N}$
- $a_i \in \mathbb{R}$
- $y = f(x) : \dot{y} \in \mathbb{R}$
- $\phi: \mathbb{R} \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$

To solve, such equation, we put
$$\phi(x) = 0$$
and,
$$\sum_{i = 0}^n{a_i\frac{d^i}{dx^i}y} = 0$$

Using the continuous derivative function, we can re-write the equation as

$$\sum_{i = 0}^n{a_{i}D^i y} = 0$$
