Parallel Asymptotes are the [[Asymptotes]] to a curve which are parallel to the axes. Since there are two axes, there are two kinds of parallel asymptotes:
1. [[Engg. Mathematics/Horizontal Asymptotes|Horizontal Asymptotes]]
2. [[Engg. Mathematics/Vertical Asymptotes|Vertical Asymptotes]]

The equation of a parallel asymptote is always a one-variable equation, i.e. x = constant or y = constant, because otherwise it won't be parallel to the axes. 
<!-- T_T Why do I need to write this? Even I don't know.-->

There is a shortcut to find parallel asymptotes, which is basically, you take the highest order terms of axis that the asymptote you want to find is parallel to, and set their coefficient to 0. This is discussed in more detail in the slides pertaining to the types of asymptotes and is derived individually for each axis, so as to reduce confusion.
