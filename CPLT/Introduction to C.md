C is one of the oldest High Level Programming language created by Sir Dennis Ritchie in early 1970s, which continues to inspire the design of many new programming languages, to the date.

C is a direct descendent of the ALGOL programming language, and borrows a lot of it's features from it, like the procedural style of writing.

C, for the time it was created was super easy, because of it's closeness to English, and hence opened the gates of programming for many people. 

That is not to say it didn't have any flaws but, to be fair, it's flaws were so niche that to this day, we don't have proper solutions in place for some of them.

C marked a new era of programming languages.
