Parallel Asymptotes are the [[Asymptotes]] to a curve which are parallel to the axes. Since there are two axes, there are two kinds of parallel asymptotes:
1. [[Engg. Mathematics/Horizontal Asymptotes|Horizontal Asymptotes]]
2. [[Engg. Mathematics/Vertical Asymptotes|Vertical Asymptotes]]

The maximum number of Parallel Asymptotes for an equation is order of the equation, it can be less than that, but not more.

The equation of a parallel asymptote is always a one-variable equation, i.e. x = constant or y = constant, because otherwise it won't be parallel to the axes.
