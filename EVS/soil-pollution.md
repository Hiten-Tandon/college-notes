Soil is the thin layer of organic and inorganic materials which covers the Earth's surface. Soil provides us with useful land for agriculture.

Soil pollution is defined as the presence of toxic chemicals in the soil in high concentration, such that it poses a risk to human health and the ecosystem.
It is a serious environmental concern since it poses many harms.

For ex:
  - Exposure of soil containing high concentration of Benzene(C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>6</sub>), can cause blood cancer.
  - Soil pollution can affect agriculture in 2 ways:
    1. By reducing crop yield (bad soil can only have so much nutrients)
    2. By making food unusable for human consumption (fun fact: poison is poisonous! Who knew?).
